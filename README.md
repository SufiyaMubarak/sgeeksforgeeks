 I make a clone of the GeeksforGeeks website. The clone includes home, about, courses, and contact pages. On the home page, weâ€™ve added sections like categories, features, testimonials, and FAQs, similar to the GFG website. The about page showcases achievements and introduces GFG team.
 The courses page features GFG courses, and the contact page provides contact information.
